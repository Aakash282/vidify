Vidify-app
===============

This app is meant for Spotify users that would like to watch music videos of the
currently playing track. The Spotify API, Youtube Data API, and Youtube Player API
are used heavily in the implementation. 

To test the application your Spotify account needs to have the developer flag
set. You can find out how to activate the developer flag [here](https://developer.spotify.com/technologies/apps/#developer-account).

Clone this repository in your Spotify workspace directory. If you haven't got a Spotify directory, read about where to create it [here](http://developer.spotify.com/technologies/apps/guidelines/developer/#creatinganapp). Cloning will create a subfolder called vidify-app. 

You can access the application (restart the Spotify desktop client if you have not done so) by typing in spotify:app:boilerplate-app in the search field.
Read more about this in the [Spotify Developer Guidelines](http://developer.spotify.com/technologies/apps/guidelines/developer/).
